        <h3>Classic Car</h3>
        <p>A classic car is typically an automobile 25 years or older; however, definitions vary.[note 1] A common theme is that of an older car of historical interest is collectible and tends to be restored rather than scrapped, though sometimes age is not a factor. Classic cars are often considered a subset of a broader category of "collector cars," including restored classic cars and newer exotic vehicles. A subset of classic cars are known as antique cars, manufactured before 1980, or vintage cars, manufactured before World War II.[1] <br>

        Organizations such as the Classic Car Club of America (CCCA) maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars called "classic." These are described as "fine" or "distinctive" automobiles, either American or foreign-built, produced between 1915 and 1948.</p>
