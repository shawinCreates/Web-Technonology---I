                <h2>Classic Cars</h2>
                <p>A <strong>classic car</strong> is typically an automobile 25 years or older; however, definitions vary.A common theme is that of an older car of historical interest is collectible and tends to be restored rather than scrapped, though sometimes age is not a factor. Classic cars are often considered a subset of a broader category of <i>"collector cars,"</i> including restored classic cars and newer exotic vehicles. A subset of classic cars are known as antique cars, manufactured before 1980, or vintage cars, manufactured before World War II.</p>

                <p>Organizations such as the <b>Classic Car Club of America (CCCA)</b> maintain lists of eligible unmodified cars called  <a href="#">"classic."</a>  These are described as "fine" or "distinctive" automobiles, either American or foreign-built, produced between 1915 and 1948.
            
                <i>Post-World War II</i> classic cars are not precisely defined, and the term is often applied to any older vehicle.</p>

                <h2>Vintage Cars</h2>
                <p>A <b>vintage car</b> is, in the most general sense, an old automobile, and in the narrower senses of car enthusiasts and collectors, it is a car from the period of 1919 to 1930. Such enthusiasts have categorization schemes for ages of cars that enforce distinctions between antique cars, vintage cars, classic cars, and so on. The classification criteria vary, but consensus within any country is often maintained by major car clubs, for example the <i><a href="">Vintage Sports-Car Club (VSCC)</a></i> in the UK.</p>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>The vintage era in the automotive world was a time of transition. The car started off in 1919 as still something of a rarity, and ended up, in 1930, well on the way towards ubiquity. In fact, automobile production at the end of this period was not matched again until the 1950s. In the intervening years, most industrialized countries built nationwide road systems with the result that, towards the end of the period, the ability to negotiate unpaved roads was no longer a prime consideration of automotive design.

                <p>Cars became much more practical, convenient and comfortable during this period. Car heating was introduced (progressing from hot bricks via double-skinned exhaust manifolds to the heater radiator matrix), as was the in-car radio. Four-wheel braking from a common foot pedal was introduced, as was the use of hydraulically actuated brakes.</p>

                <p>The modern car has changed a lot since the advent of the automobile. Today's cars have become much more refined than the archaic automobiles of old times of the early 1900's. Even within the last forty years cars have made giant advances in many categories. Today the automobile serves many purposes to various people. The first of which is obviously transportation. However, in addition to this primary role, the modern automobile has also become a way to move gardening supplies, a weekend fun car, a status symbol, a multimedia device, and even a house. Todays automobiles are also built all around the world, including the United States, Germany, Japan, Britain, India, China, and many more countries.</p>

                    In the 50s, gull-wing doors that opened vertically were relatively new. So was fuel injection, which made the Mercedes 300SL Gullwing one of the fastest cars on Mercedes' line at the time. This Mercedes 300SL Gullwing is often considered the starting point for several vehicle features we have today.

                    When Germany was defeated in WWII, their family car concept was too good for the British not to build on. Postwar West Germany began regularly producing Volkswagen Beetle in the 50s until they swept the American car market in the following decade. There's a certain charm to driving around a classic bug, as they are called.
